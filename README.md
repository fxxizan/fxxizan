# Hey! <img src = "https://gifdb.com/images/high/cute-wave-emoji-hand-59s88kk0zj3xho40.webp" width = "30" height = "30">

My name is Faizan, a Pakistani developer primarily working on ROBLOX games! <img src = "https://cdn.pixabay.com/animation/2022/09/06/03/13/03-13-18-245_512.gif" width = "23" height = "12">
I currently work on games affiliated with [Tactical Triumph](https://www.roblox.com/groups/13436106/Tactical-Triumph), a game development studio specialised in creating football (soccer) games on the ROBLOX platform. I enjoy playing football, cricket and rounders (baseball) and I also enjoy game development. I'm 16 years old currently studying maths, economics and sociology at 6th form for my A Levels.
